                What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?
            </h3>
            <p>
                The experience conveys its goal well, it's a tricky balancing act managing the digital ecosystem.
                Have to constantly add in different species to balance each other while managing the oxygen.

                How does the experience communicate it's primary goal?
            </h3>
            <p>
                The oxygen metre is a measure of success, when it is in the red you know that you are not doing what you are supposed to and 
                when it is in the middle green you know that you are doing well at balancing the ecosystem.

            <h3>
                What is your impression of the intended length of a single interaction and how often you are intended to interact with the experience?
            </h3>
            <p>
                The length of a single interaction is variable, you can manage the metre or sculpt out an interesting habitat for your creatures.
                You can also try to add more fish in for more colour. If just managing the metre, the length of a single interaction is only a couple of seconds.
                When sculpting a habitat, it can take at least 10 seconds.
                The system can be slowed down and sped up, on fast mode you need to interact with the orb constantly to manage the metre. 
                On slow you can be more relaxed and check in every couple of minutes.

            </h3>
            <p>
                The ocean background is calming and helps the user feel more immersed in their sea creature orb farm. 
                The orb is similar to a fish bowl and makes the user feel as if they are building a real aquarium. 
                The pixel art and old web browser aesthetic gives it a unique style, it feels almost like an old arcade game, 
                and it reminds users of projects similar to it like Tamogatchi.

        <section id="frustrating" class="sections">
            <h3>
                What is the most frustrating element of the interaction and what makes it frustrating to you?
            </h3>
            <p>
                A lot of the interactions are adding algae into the orb, this usually requires frantically moving your mouse from side to side to add more. 
                It would be alot more user friendly if there was a “brush size” option so that you could bulk add elements.
            </p>

        <section id="satisfying" class="sections">
            <h3>
                What is the most satisfying element of the interaction and what makes it satisfying to you?
            </h3>
            <p>
                The pixels dropping into place as you add sand or grass into the orb is visually satisfying. 
                It makes the experience feel fluid and more immersive than if the pixels were just added exactly where you clicked. 
                This also lets you have more freedom in placing objects as you don’t have to be super precise, it's a good quality of life 
                addition.
