            1) Spend two minutes with the experience and list all of your actions in granular detail.
        </h2>
        <p1>
            Place Sand
            Sculpt Branches and rocks into a nice landscape
            Add grass
            Place water
            Add Daphnia
            Add algae to feed them
            Add some cool fish
            Add bacteria to break down dead daphnia
            Look at co2 and oxygen metre
            Add more algae to balance out the co2
            Look at info diagram to see how to manage the metre better
            Periodically place more algae
            Add more fish 
        </p1>

            2) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?
        </h2>
        <p1>
            All the items/creatures I could add to the orb farm
        </p1>
        <h2>
            3) What did you spend the most time engaging with?
        </h2>
        <p1>
            Managing the oxygen metre
        </p1>
        <h2>
            4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?
        </h2>
        <p1>
            Adding more algae to increase the oxygen metre
        </p1>
        <h2>
            5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?
        </h2>
        <p1>
            Conveys its goal well, it's a tricky balancing act managing the digital ecosystem.
            Have to constantly add in different species to balance each other while managing the oxygen.
        </p1>
        <h2>
            6) How does the experience communicate it's primary goal?
        </h2>
        <p1>
            The oxygen metre is a measure of success, when it is in the red you know that you are not doing what you are supposed to and 
            when it is in the middle green you know that you are doing well at balancing the ecosystem.
        </p1>
        <h2>
            7) What is your impression of the intended length of a single interaction and how often you are intended to interact with the experience?
        </h2>
        <p1>
            The length of a single interaction is variable, you can manage the metre or sculpt out an interesting habitat for your creatures.
            You can also try to add more fish in for more colour. If just managing the metre, the length of a single interaction is only a couple of seconds.
            When sculpting a habitat, it can take at least 10 seconds.
            The system can be slowed down and sped up, on fast mode you need to interact with the orb constantly to manage the metre. 
            On slow you can be more relaxed and check in every couple of minutes.
