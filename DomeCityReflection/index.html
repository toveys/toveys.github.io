                    This work is an interactive browser game set in a fictional domed city. 
                    In this city a corporate automated future has been achieved and machines have taken over as the primary labour force. 
                    Luxury goods are in abundance but are not affordable to the majority of people. 
                    I created different social classes and I explored the dynamic between them. 
                    In this capitalist world a paradox is shown when it comes to increasing automation, the more people you can cut out and save money, the less money people will have to buy your goods.

                    I decided to create this project because I realised during COVID that due to safety concerns many businesses started looking increasingly into automation. 
                    For example grocery stores used to have many cashiers, but during this time they were all replaced with self checkouts. 
                    The profitability that comes with more automation is something that more and more businesses are interested in.

                    I used a combination of Adobe Illustrator to create the visuals as well as HTML, CSS, and Javascript to code the interactive webpage. 
                    I created a map of the city to better ground my story and as the user goes to different locations a banner image of that new location is displayed. 
                    I created stylized images of main buildings so that their design represented their role and how people perceive them. 
                    I made this a browser game which I uploaded to itch.io since I am focusing on narrative gaming experiences similar to this. 
                    I was also inspired by the game Fallen London, another browser game that explores an industrial underground London, as well as the game Cultist Simulator which explored a Lovecraftian cult in London.
                    Their abstract world building helped me alot in the making of my project as well as their techniques in using simplistic art to tell a story.
