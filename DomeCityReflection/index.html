                    My work takes place in a domed city where a corporate automated future has been achieved. 
                    Machines have taken over as the primary labour force. 
                    The majority of the unemployed population live in a dome sustained by a rationed food source and the primary way to make money is to sell off your bone marrow to the upper class elites. 
                    The upper class extract stem cells from bone marrow and use it in gene modification. Luxury goods are in abundance but are not affordable to the majority of people.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In my work I have created different social classes and I explore the dynamic between them. I focus on 4 types of people, which you can play as.
                    A neo-luddite religious class, they believe that instead of automating machines, the stem-cell technology should be used to enhance the abilities of all people so that they can perform labour themselves. 
                    They belive that mankind was meant to do labour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Marrow Thief, they profit from selling stem cells to different groups of people. The religious groups use them for enhancing their body, but other groups of people use it as a drug to enhance their pleasure sensors.
                    A Maintainer, they are one of the few groups of people that have a standard job. They fix the machines that keep the city running.
                    A representative from another city, they inspect the city so that they can report back to the capital. 
                    But the main company in the city is able to influence them to control potentially negative information from leaking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I made this as a browser based text game with artwork so that people could be more immersed in the city I have created. 
                    I created stylized abstract images of main buildings so that their design represented their role and how people perceive them. 
                    I decided to create this project because I realise that during COVID, due to safety concerns, many businesses started looking increasingly into automation. 
                    For example, my grocery store in my hometown used to have many cashiers, but during this time they were all replaced with self checkouts. 
                    The profitability of becoming more automated is something that more and more businesses are interested in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I have most of my artwork and the interactive elements completed but I don’t have as much functionality as I had originally planned. 
                    Each character you play should influence the overall story and change how people in the city interact with you, but this was too ambitious. 
                    Currently the choice is flavour only, you do get some more background of the classes, but it doesn’t change anything else. 
                    Instead of being a game that takes place in the city, I pretty much ended up creating an interactive sightseeing tour.
                    I am the most proud of the artwork, I think that it helps tie my work together into something narratively interesting. 
                    Having something to see while reading about my locations helps ground my work. 
                    I had never made something like this before and I have very little experience in Illustrator so much of my time was dedicated to creating the artwork. 
                    Making the map was the most ambitious, it still has room for locations so technically it isn’t completed due to cut locations but I am proud of how it turned out.
                    I had to cut locations out of the work to meet time which I am disappointed about, but I wanted something visual to accompany every location.
